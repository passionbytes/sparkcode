int plusOne(int x)
{
  return x+1;
}

//Above function written in Java will always give same answer for plusOne(5). Hence plusOne(5) can be replaced with 6.

//Consider below : Referentially opaque. i.e NOT referentially transparent

int g =10;//Note its a global variable, anyone can change the value

int plusG(int x)
{
  return x+ g;
}

//If we call plusG(5), result depends on value of g, which can be ste with any v//alue by anyone. Hence plusG is not referentially transaparent
